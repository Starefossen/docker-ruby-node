## Why Node.js and Ruby together?

Some applications, like Jekyll, GitHub pages or Rails with Webpacker, requires both Ruby and Node.js
installed in the same image in order to run or fully function.

## How to use this image

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -p "8080:8080" starefossen/ruby-node
```

## Image Variants

The `starefossen/ruby-node` images come in three flavors, each designed for a
specific use case.

`starefossen/ruby-node:latest`

This is the defacto image. If you are unsure about what your needs are, you
probably want to use this one. It is designed to be used both as a throw away
container (mount your source code and start the container to start your app), as
well as the base to build other images off of.

`starefossen/ruby-node:slim`

A slimmed down image, identical to the `:latest` tag except it is based a Debian
base image with fewer packages and dependencies installed like without GCC and
various build tools.

`starefossen/ruby-node:alpine`

This is the smalles image possible. It is based on the Alpine Linux base image.

## Default Locale
Versions 2-6, 2-8 (latest and slim) has defined locale C.UTF-8 instead default POSIX.
