## Why Node.js and Ruby together?

Some applications, like Jekyll, GitHub pages or Rails with Webpacker, requires both Ruby and Node.js
installed in the same image in order to run or fully function. This image do not install any other packages than both other images do.

## Differences with official Ruby and Node.js images?

Ruby: Same as official.

Node: Instead variables NODE_VERSION and YARN_VERSION is available variable NODE_MAJOR fullfiled with major version of node.js. Node is not executed on by CMD.

## How to use this image

```
$ docker run -v "$PWD":/usr/src/app -p "8080:8080" starefossen/ruby-node
```
